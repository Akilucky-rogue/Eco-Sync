## 🚨 Problem Statement

### **Marine Pollution Crisis in India**

India's coastal ecosystem faces an unprecedented environmental crisis:

- **7,517 km coastline** severely impacted by marine pollution
- **1.5+ million tons** of plastic waste entering oceans annually
- **Fragmented efforts** with no unified coordination platform
- **Low community engagement** in sustained environmental action
- **Limited impact tracking** of cleanup and conservation efforts
- **Disconnected stakeholders** (NGOs, volunteers, organizations)
- **Lack of awareness** about marine conservation among citizens

### **Core Challenges Identified**

1. **🔗 Coordination Gap**: No centralized platform for organizing marine cleanup events
2. **📉 Engagement Problem**: Low sustained participation in environmental activities  
3. **👻 Impact Invisibility**: No systematic tracking of cleanup achievements
4. **🏝️ Community Disconnect**: Volunteers and organizations working in isolation
5. **📚 Education Deficit**: Limited environmental awareness and marine knowledge
6. **🎯 Motivation Issues**: Lack of incentives and recognition for contributions
